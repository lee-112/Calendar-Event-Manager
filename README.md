# **Calendar Event Manager**
The Calendar Event Manager is a program designed to help you manage all of your weekly scheduled appointments, activities, and events.

## **Background**
This project was developed for my Programming Systems course at Portland State University. The purpose of this assignment was to develop and build a program that focused on the concept of object-oriented programming, hierarchy classes, and dynamic binding.

## **How does it work**
The program works by using a menu interface which allows for the creation, removal, updating, finding, and display of any saved events. 

## **How to run the program**
First, ensure that you have GCC complier installed on your local system in order to compile and run the source code. Once GCC complier is installed, from your terminal simply compile the source code by running the g++ with the cpp files from the command line. Once complied run ./ from the command to execute the program.
